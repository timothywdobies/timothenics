# Hero Image

Place your calisthenics training photo here as `hero-image.jpg`

**Requirements:**
- Filename: `hero-image.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)
- Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Subject: Action shot of calisthenics training
- Orientation: Landscape (horizontal)

**Tips for best results:**
- High resolution image works best
- Good lighting and contrast
- The image will have a dark overlay to keep text readable
- Center-focused composition works well since text is centered

Once you add your image, the hero section will automatically use it as the background.
